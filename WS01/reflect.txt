1)What have you learned in completing this workshop?
Ans: The first and foremost thing that I got to learn after completing this workshop is to use visual studio 2022 to code C 
programs and how we use the .c extension every time we program in the C compiler. It is a very convenient way with several 
different tools like IntelliCode(which gives suggestions) to edit and run our coding programs. This workshop also taught me 
about SSH and SFTP which were used to interact and transfer files respectively to the Linux server and VPN used to provide 
additional security for the file transfer. Talking about the coding point of view, I learned about the entry point of the 
program which is #include <stdio.h> which identifies the printf identifier. Next, I got to know about three different escape 
sequences that are \t equivalent to 2 spaces to the right,\n which is used to shift to a new line, and \" used to represent the
double quote character in output which we cannot get directly in the printf function. Lastly, I learned about return 0 which 
means that the program was successfully executed.

2)Briefly describe what SSH is and how did you use it in this workshop?
Ans: SSH i.e. Secured Shell is a protocol which is used to connect and interact with another computer or server. This helps in
transferring files and directories from one computer to another. I used an SSH application called puTTY to interact with a
Linux server to transfer my workshop files in it to submit my workshop 1. I logged into the puTTy application through
my matrix account and made a directory named IPC 144 and inside of that, I made another that is w01. This was the location 
where in I had to transfer files from my local computer. After transferring my files with the help of an SFTP application 
named FileZilla I submitted my workshop by running the submitting command.

3)Briefly describe what SFTP is and how did you use it in this workshop?
Ans: SFTP i.e. Secured File Transfer Protocol is used to transfer files and directories in a secured shell.SFTP is the mixture 
of Secured Shell and File Transfer Protocol that keeps the transferring process more secure and safe and most importantly, out 
of reach of hackers. I used an SFTP application named FileZilla to transfer my files. After making a connection with the host, 
I dragged source files from my local computer to the remote matrix directory w01 in ipc 144 that I made earlier with help of 
the puTTy application. There is also another application named WinSCP which can be used as an SFTP application.
